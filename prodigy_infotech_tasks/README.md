# Prodigy InfoTech Internship Tasks

This directory contains Python implementations for 5 different cybersecurity-related tasks as part of the Prodigy InfoTech internship.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 01: Caesar Cipher
- **Description:** A Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
- **File:** `task_01_caesar_cipher.py`

### Task 02: Image Encryption (Pixel Manipulation)
- **Description:** A simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. It swaps pixel values or applies basic mathematical operations to encrypt and decrypt images.
- **File:** `task_02_image_encryption.py`

### Task 03: Password Complexity Checker
- **Description:** A tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password's strength.
- **File:** `task_03_password_checker.py`

### Task 04: Simple Keylogger
- **Description:** A basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes to a file.
- **File:** `task_04_keylogger.py`
- **Note:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal.

### Task 05: Network Packet Analyzer
- **Description:** A packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. It displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.
- **File:** `task_05_packet_analyzer.py`
- **Note:** Ensure ethical use of this tool. Unauthorized network sniffing is prohibited.
